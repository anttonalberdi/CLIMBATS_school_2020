Researchers often need to quantify how diverse different systems are, for example, to assess ecosystem functioning (Cardinale, Palmer, & Collins, 2002) or to measure any species' niche breadth (Forister et al., 2015). It is also common to compare the composition of different systems, under experimental set‐ups to measure the dif‐ ferences yielded by different treatments (e.g., Gevers et al., 2014), or in observational designs to assess whether and how much dietary niches differ (e.g., Kartzinel et al., 2015). A myriad of approaches and tools has been developed over the last century to perform such operations, each embedded within a statistical background, with popular examples including Shannon index quadratic entropy (Rao, 1982), Pianka's niche overlap (Pianka, 1974) and Unifrac distances (Lozupone & Knight, 2005).

Regardless of the specific approach implemented, researchers need to make at least four essential choices when analysing the diversity of a biological system. 

* First, they must define the unit that encompasses biologically alike entities to be used to measure diversity, hereafter referred to as the “type”. Although community ecologists have traditionally measured diversity using the taxonomic species as the type (Pielou, 1966), with the implementation of molecular approaches, this is no longer a general rule (Blaxter et al., 2005). 

* Second, it is necessary to consider how detections of these types are treated, either as presence/absence (=incidence) or quantitatively (=abundance), and if the latter, how abundant and rare detections are weighed (Jost, 2006). 

* Third, researchers need to con‐ sider whether, and how, the phylogenetic—or ecological—relations between detected organisms will be accounted for when measur‐ ing diversity (Chao, Chiu, & Jost, 2014a). 

* Finally, researchers should ideally assess whether the data are representative of the biological system studied, and if needed, take the necessary measures to cor‐ rect the biases.

## Defining types for diversity quantification

In community ecology, individuals (i.e., recorded entities) have been traditionally classified into taxonomic species (i.e., types). Therefore, diversity measurements have commonly been carried out at spe‐ cies level (e.g., species richness and species diversity), principally as determined based on morphological features (MacArthur, 1965; Pielou, 1966). The implementation of DNA‐based molecular approaches now enables (in principle) diversity to be measured at a much finer scale—that of DNA sequence variation. Molecularly defined types, broadly known as OTUs or MOTUs (molecular operational taxonomic units, Blaxter et al., 2005), are becoming the preferred types with which to quantify diversity in many fields of the biological sciences. When using molecular approaches, the recorded entities are no longer individuals, but DNA sequences, and the classification into types is not any longer based on morphological features, but the level of dissimilarity between DNA sequences.
